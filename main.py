#   annual rate and/or number of years which in the implementation of the 
#   functions is automatically converted to monthly rate and number of months
print(npf.fv(rate, nper, pmt, pv))

# This creates an array of monthly interest rates when the annual interest rate 
#   is 5%, 6%, and 7% respectively

# This prints the future value of a $100 payment made monthly for 10 years at 
#   5%, 6%, and 7% interest rates

# This is an example of minor design decision that I would like to make work;
#   (allow users to call function with uppercase letters as that is the standard
#   in Economics)

# print(npf.FV(intRates, 10*12, -100, -100))
 

#  An example of the more interesting and useful design I would like to have 
#   work would be assigning values in the call to the function such as

# print(npf.FV(r = 7%, years = 10, pmt = -100, pv = -100))
