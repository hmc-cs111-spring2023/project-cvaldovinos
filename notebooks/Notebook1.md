# Design notebook entry

## Last week's critique

Fill in this part with a summary and reflection on the critique you received for
last week's work. Answer questions such as:  How, specifically, did the feedback help
improve the project? Did the feedback point out or offer something you hadn't considered?
Did it help you make a design decision? Was it helpful in addressing the most pressing
issues in your project? How will you incorporate the feedback into your work? Will you
change something about the design, implementation, or evaluation as a result?

I thought that the critique was very good for giving me clear points on what I
should focus on and further consider when implementing my language. One example
that the feedback pointed out which I had not considered was creating a clear
ranking of what functionality I want to prioritize. While I know I wanted to
prioritize some things over others, I had not created a list. I think this was
particularly useful feedback at this stage of the project because having a
clearer plan will allow me to ensure I am staying on track later and not falling
into time-sink issues as we discussed in class so that what I am working on is
crucial functionality and not unnecessary to the goals for my DSL.

## Description

Fill in this part with information about your work this week:
important design decisions, changes to previous decisions, open questions,
exciting milestones, preliminary results, etc. Feel free to include images
(e.g., a sketch of the design or a screenshot of a running program), links to
code, and any other resources that you think will help clearly convey your
design process.

In the discussion this past Monday, I mentioned how in my research for my
project pitch I found a numpy library which achieves a very similar goal to the
outcome I was looking for with my DSL. So I spent much of the studio time this
week learning how to use that library and then trying to perform different
calculations with it.

Then after having gotten experience with using the library, I commented the code
so that I could compare the written explanation of the calculations I performed
and the code.

Finally, I reflected on this library and what features I thought were missing
from the goals I outlined in my project pitch. I also considered two examples of
different designs, one more crucial and one minor change which is not important
for user needs.

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

I have decided to implement my DSL as an external DSL so I need to implement the
language's architecture. To begin, I am looking back to samples from prior 
assignments and the External Techniques 1 and 2 lessons from Week 7.

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

Did any others implement external DSLs for the picobot assignment or have you 
begun doing so for your projects? I'm not sure where is the best point to get 
started with doing so. Should I start with the implementation in the host
language? The parser? Or should I just write code in my ideal implementation
and work back to the host language from there?

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the work?**

I spent about 6 hours on the project this week.

**Compared to what you wrote in your contract about what you want to get out of this
project, how did this week go?**

I think I experienced more issues as far as implementation this week compared to
my contract. However, I think this is more due to the fact that there was still
work to be done considering the design especially with the feedback that was
provided. I do not feel that I have fallen behind with my DSL as I know that I
have my design ideas and plan and more clear after having discussed them with
others. Also, Prof. Ben mentioned that we likely should not be coding much this
week and I think my experience was similar to that so I think my plan for week 1
in my contract had just not accounted for the exploration of designs that I
needed to do.
